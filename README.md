# Procedural Animation in Unity

[Procedural Animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_animation) example in Unity.

[Skeletal animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation) uses a key frame animation clip, which contains transforms of joints in chronological order. These pre-recorded animation clips are just "played" on a bone model.

This method uses [IK (Inverse Kinematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics) to procedurally position joints, so it automatically generates animation in real-time. This allows for a more diverse series of actions and real-time interaction with environmental features.
